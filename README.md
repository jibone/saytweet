saytweet - a silly little node.js app that searches and says tweets.
====================================================================

This little app uses the '[say](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html)' command in MacOSX which converts text to audioble speech. So I guess it only works in MacOSX..

To run:

	$ node saytweet.js
